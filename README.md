### Synopsis
A basic collision detection simulator written in MatLab. The program simulates collisions between N particles and the rectangular boundaries. 

There are 4 parts to the basic simulator:

- Collision Detection function via the UNIFORM GRID algorithm

- Function to determine collision times

- Function for time-stepping and resolving collisions

- Rendering simulation as a movie file

#### Bonus Features
For extra credit, the following features have been implemented:

1) Gravitational Effects

2) Inelastic Collisions

3) Brownian Dynamics

4) Heterogenous Disk Mass

5) Heterogenous Disk Radius

6) Periodic Boundary Conditions

7) Particle Sink/Source

Further details and elaboration are found in the report.
